British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities. Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.
# Objectives
1. Scrap and collect customer feedback and review data from a third-party source.
2. Pre-process the text-data and analyse this data to present any insights you may uncover.
3. Manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data to build a high-quality predictive model.
4. Train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking with the airway.

# Prediction Model
The customer Booking data was trained on a RandomForest in order to predict if a customer will book a flight with the airway. The performance of the model was evaluated by implementing Cross-validation and the appropriate evaluation metrics.
